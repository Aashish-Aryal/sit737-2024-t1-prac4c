## Step 1
Create a package.json file with required dependencies. Run `npm install` to install the packages mentioned in package.json file.

## Step 2
Adding functions and api endpoints for exponential, square root and modulo operations to the JavaScript code of 4.1P. <br>

Unlike the previous arithmetic opetations,the square root function and api take only one argument as the input and returns square root of the input number. But the exponential and modulo functions take 2 arguments as input. The exponential function returns n1^n2 and the modulo function returns remainder of n1/n2 operation.
